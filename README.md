# React Native Intern Assignment - JobsFeed

**Live Demo:** [View on Netlify]([(https://jobsfeed.netlify.app/)])

## Description
This React Native application was developed as part of an internship assignment. It contains three main screens:

1. **Splash Screen** – Displayed when the app is launched for the first time.  
2. **Home Feed** – Inspired by the job listing layout on JobsFeed, implemented with dummy data.  
3. **Settings Screen** – Based on the JobsFeed settings page, implemented with dummy data.  

The app demonstrates functionality, clean UI/UX, and modular, well-structured code. A simulated backend is used instead of real server integration.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Functionality and smooth navigation  
- User interface and experience quality  
- Code readability, reusability, and organization
